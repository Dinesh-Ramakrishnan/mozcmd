These are the commands created during the Firefox Command Line Hackathon

Zero testing has been done on these commands. This is a frankenrepo containing
a mostly blind merge of the submitted gists and pull requests of this repo.
So we've not done a security audit, checked licenses or even run the commands,
just collated what was sent our way.

To use this directory from Firefox, set the devtools.commands.dir to point at
the parent directory of this README (i.e. the root of this repo)
