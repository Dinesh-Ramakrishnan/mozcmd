These are the commands created during the Firefox Command Line Hackathon

Zero testing has been done on these commands. This is a frankenrepo containing
a mostly blind merge of the submitted gists and pull requests of this repo.
So we've not done a security audit, checked licenses or even run the commands,
just collated what was sent our way.

For a summary of the day and the commands, see:
